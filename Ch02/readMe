#Intro Babel and JSX

* Babel - It is a transpiler which is used to convert Javascript into different versions.
* JSX - React uses JSX for templating instead of regular JavaScript. It is not necessary to use it, however, following are some pros that come with it.

        It is faster because it performs optimization while compiling code to JavaScript.

        It is also type-safe and most of the errors can be caught during compilation.

        It makes it easier and faster to write templates, if you are familiar with HTML.
